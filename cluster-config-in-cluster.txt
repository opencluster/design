Now that we have the concept of different zones, there will be an internal config zone, that will contain cluster information and will 
be distribued to all the nodes the same way that other clustered data is distributed.

The internal cluster zone, is sync'd just like every other zone, and in order to modify it, you must have the appropriate key.

This internal zone will also have all the information about all the other nodes in the cluster.  The balancing could all be done via 
that information, rather than being built into the protocol with the periodic LOADLEVEL request.  Might have to think about that in 
case there are valid reasons not to do it that way.

This also means that future changes with how the balancing is done, can pretty much be done without changing the protocol.  Just change 
how that internal data is used.  As long as the protocol handles the operations needed to act on that data.

This way, when a new node key is added, the other server nodes get access to it, and can authenticate the other nodes.   
The same thing with the zones and the clients.

Once a zone is added to the cluster, all the nodes need to get that information and authenticate clients that want to use that zone, 
and receive data for it.
