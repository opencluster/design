# Services

Services control things that are on the host itself and not actual containers.  It could even be a service that references and uses a container.
They resemble, are similar to, and ultimately utilise SystemD service files.

Containers that are added to an environment, can automatically create a corresponding service, or the default can be over-ridden and the service modified.
