# Authentication

Authentication on all the products should be accomplished by protected security keys.

For the most part, we will use Private/Public keys.  These are easy to generate, and allow people to use a password in a similar fashion to what they are used to, but the underlying mechanism utilises a more secure and private system.

This also allows us to have a system where the actual passwords people use are not stored in the system itself.
