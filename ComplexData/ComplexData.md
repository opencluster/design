# Complex Data

This  data storage service allows data to be stored in a complex way with the focus on being able to retrieve a large amount of data in a single request (eg, reducing the amount of data requests needed to get all teh data required to render a webpage).   It is not meant to be a direct corollary replacement of SQL.  If you require SQL, use it, not this.   This is meant to be a more complex NoSQL implementation.  We will not be including a loose query language... although the requests are structured.
