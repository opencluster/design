# Getting Started

The general idea is that you start off with a system somewhere that has docker installed. This initial system does not need to be in the final environment, for example it could start out as a small digital-ocean droplet, or a small amazon node.

You pull down a docker image, and run it.  It will walk you through the process of setting up a command center.  Once the command-center is up and running, you instead only need to use that.

## Remote Start

Additionally, at some point, OpenCluster will provide a publically available service that will assist with the setup.  This will most commonly be a web-based interface that just sets up a temporary node (docker container) that will assist the user with a startup.  They will be walked through the process, and when they have their own controller setup, will transfer functionality to it.

## Remote Management

OpenCluster also intends to provide a paid service which provides customers with an OpenCluster Controller instance, and will likely also provide other service as well.
