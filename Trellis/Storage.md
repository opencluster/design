# Storage

Different types of Storage can be attached to a role.  Some can be very stand-alone, and some can provide some HA and redundancy capabilities.  The storage options chosen will depend on the resources available.   It can range from a container that has an exported volume that automatically sync's the contents to another identical container, to backend redundant storage like SAN's with site sync, etc.
