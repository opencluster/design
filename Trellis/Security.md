# Security

The entirety of the OpenCluster suite needs to take security very seriously, and ensure that the entire environment follows best practices for a secure envioronment.

All access to the environment will be handled by security keys.  For convenience will provide a system where the private keys can be encrypted with a passphrase and available in the system, so for most people, they access the systems with a password, but internally it is using private/public keys.
