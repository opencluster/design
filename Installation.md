# Installation

This is a initial expectation of what Installation would be like.  This will be adjusted as development continues.

## Expected Experience

OpenCluster has a LOT of options and capabilties, but it can be overwhelming at the start.  So we want an initial system that is easy to implement, and then guide in teh right path for easy expansion.

### Local installation

* New user visits the website, and indicate they want to implement a solution.
* The site gives them the option to download the installer, or they can use the online solution which starts things up for them.
* New user obtains the installer and extracts it on some Linux server or desktop.
* They run the installer and it asks them questions.
  * Do they already have a system setup they want to run the Controller on?  If so, it will ask for connection details.
