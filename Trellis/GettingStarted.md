# Getting Started

The general idea is that you start off with a system somewhere that has docker installed. This initial system does not need to be in the final environment, for example it could start out as a small digital-ocean droplet, or a small amazon node.

You pull down a docker image, and run it.  It will walk you through the process of setting up a command center.  Once the command-center is up and running, you instead only need to use that.
