This lifecycle is for the model where the cluster daemon is running natively on the server.  Another lifecycle will be created for 
scalable docker and container images.

The cluster daemon is installed.

The config /etc/opencluster/opencluster.conf is updated based on your requirements.
Some config options will be the logging type, etc.

The primary admin key is generated and placed in /etc/opencluster/keys

The cluster is started, with the specific options to create a new cluster, rather than joining a cluster.

A new key is created and added for another node to join the cluster.
It can be set with the maximum number of nodes that can use this key.  If you want a different key per node, then you would set this to 1.

A new key is generated and added to a new zone.  This will be the admin key for a zone.

The admin key in the zone can be used to create new keys and add them to the zone with specific access rights.



New node is started up, and given the public key that it uses to connect to the other nodes.
