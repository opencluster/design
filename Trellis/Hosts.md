### Hosts

Hosts can be added to Roles.  The actual host themselves do not have to be exclusive or dedicated to Trellis, but obviously anything on there should not conflict with it.  In other words, it is perfectly acceptable to have trellis hosts that have additional things installed on them.  Quite possibly monitoring services, or management and maintenance tools, logging services, etc.
