Startup Sequence of the server

1.  Parse command line parameters.  There may not be any.  if -h is chosen, then the app closes. if -k is chosen, then it uses the next parameter as the location of the config file.

2.  Load the config file.

3.  Process the info in the config file.  Certain combinations of config will result in some slightly different startup code.

4.  Fork to the new username if in daemon mode.

5.  Setup event system

6.  Create Sync startup event.

7.  Create Query startup event. 







When a new server node is starting up, it first must either create a new cluster (which is complete), or connect to the existing cluster nodes.   Before accepting connections from clients, it probably would be a good idea to ensure that it can actually connect to all the server nodes that it needs to connect to.

This is required because the cluster needs to be balanced, and it can only be balanced if all the nodes can talk to each other.

While it is in this unconnected state, it will not accept loadlevel requests either.

It will keep attempting to connect to all the nodes in the cluster.  When it is able to, it will accept client connections.
