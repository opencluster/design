Trellis 


Most of the functionality of Trellis can be enabled or disabled.


## Licensing

As with all of OpenCluster it is opensource, and supported by the community.  However, OpenCluster provides the ability to pay for additional support and training.  The opencluster products do not need to be licenced.



## Monitoring.

The OpenCluster system can provide a monitoring interface to support personal.   If you dont want to use the built-in monitoring but instead feed events into your existing monitoring infrastructure, then the events themselves can be fed directly to most monitoring systems, or scripts can be triggered for ultimate flexibility on handling events.  In most cases, a combination of these solutions can be put in place.
