Config file.

Originally I was wanting to use parameters passed to the command-line to start up the server daemon, but now that we are providing a bunch of paths to files, it can be a bit cumbersome.  Also, with the systemd method of starting and stopping components you have a lot more flexibility in starting up daemons, which may be better to have config locked down in config files, rather than as params on the command line.

So most of the command-line params will go, and the rest will be in a config file at the default location.  The default location would be /etc/opencluster/opencluster.conf

The only remaining command-line params will be:
 - help / usage
 - path to config file.

Development Notes;

There does not appear to be a standard .ini file parser that is used by default on most linux systems.  Since I want to limit the amount of pre-requisite libraries that need to be installed, I'm thinking about building my own.

I've actually written a couple of ini file parsers in the past.   I'm very tempted to use JSON, but, those files are harder to have inline comments, and may be a barrier to entry as it makes things seemingly a bit more complicated for the end user who needs to config it, even though it would make things a lot easier for me.
